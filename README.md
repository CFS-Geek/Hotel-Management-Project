# Hotel-Management-Project
Overview Of The Project

The objective of the project was to develop an easy to use and pocket friendly working alternative to other Hotel Management System. This desktop application uses MySQL as its backend to store, read and write to databases which stores tables which include;
1)	Cust – Table
2)	Rooms – Table 
3)	Issued_rooms – Table.
Below I have added a flow chart to summarizes how my application runs.

In simple words the whole application is running using python 3 and MySQL. I created a local database called Hotel_man for the purpose of storing all the data for example the tables, it is hosted locally and took me nearly no time to create it. The python GUI which I used is called Tkinter and is a free to use GUI module.
